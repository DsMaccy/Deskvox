Building virvo from SVN
=======================

Use ./autogen.sh to generate configure, pass any options you
would pass to configure to autogen.sh.

Then proceed with the usual ./configure && make && sudo make install.

Having the NVIDIA Cg toolkit installed is strongly recommended,
see the output of ./configure --help for specifying its location.
