Features to add:

- Save background color to registry and reuse next time program starts

- Alex will add flag to hdr format to specify voxel order (xyz or zyx)

- Instead of suppress rendering, render small version of data set (eg, 64^3)

- checkbox: use symmetric binning (around 0)
  Will be used implicitly when skip range widget is present

- checkbox: enable dynamic bins:
  iso-range bins = each bin covers same value range
  iso-data bins = each bin contains same amount/percentage of data values
  opacity-weighted bins
  opacity-weighted/iso-data bins

- add two additional opacity widgets:
  > freehand for Graham
  > control points for Amit

- allow to specify separate TF for each channel; do by adding tabs to TF window, one tab per channel

- allow to add 2D textures to volumes and display separate from volume for reference; i.e., topology info

- add viewing mode which consists of 3 orthogonal projections (top, front, right)

- add markers and marker interaction

- clipping plane: draw whole volume with OpenGL clipping plane and whatever rendering algorithm is used. if in 3D texturing mode: draw additional plane at clipping plane location. (get rid of current approach which draws all slices parallel to clip plane)

- orientation axes: draw opaque solid ball in center at correct z position so that it is easier to see if the lines point into or out of the screen

- save TF to file in Amit's format



Bugs to fix:

- Sample distance doesn't always work in bricking mode

- Fix Accept button when inputting RGB colors for background
  in RGB mode type in number, doesn't update right away, even accept doesn't use the selected color

- Fix problem loading Amit's data set in viewport aligned slices mode: segfaults

- bricking mode crashes in parallel projection mode

- loading movie scripts generates segfault

- in bricking mode: sample distances don't work


Done:

- checkbox: merge files by filename, not number
- Skip Range widget
- add button to import TF in TFE dialog window
- fixed: Browse for movie directory: OK never accepts, should pass string back
