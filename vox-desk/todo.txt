Features to add:

- two additional opacity widgets:
  > freehand for Graham
  > control points for Amit
- viewing mode which consists of 3 orthogonal projections (top, front, right)
- markers and marker interaction
- clipping plane: draw whole volume with OpenGL clipping plane and whatever rendering algorithm is used. if in 3D texturing mode: draw additional plane at clipping plane location. (get rid of current approach which draws all slices parallel to clip plane)
- orientation axes: draw opaque solid ball in center at correct z position so that it is easier to see if the lines point into or out of the screen
